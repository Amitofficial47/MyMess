### **Abstract**

The "MyMess" project is a full-stack web application designed to digitize and streamline the operations of a university or college hostel mess. The primary objective is to replace outdated, manual systems of meal tracking and management with an efficient, transparent, and user-friendly digital platform. The system caters to different user roles, including Students, Mess Admins, Hostel Admins, and a Super Admin, each with a tailored dashboard and specific permissions.

Students can view the weekly menu, select their daily meals (including quantity), choose add-ons, and generate a unique, single-use token for meal collection. They can also track their meal history and view an estimated monthly bill. Mess Admins are equipped with a simple interface to verify these tokens instantly, view active orders (with add-ons), and manage the daily menu. Hostel Admins oversee user management for their specific hostel, including approving new student registrations and managing mess admin accounts. The Super Admin has global oversight of the entire system, with the ability to manage all users and hostels.

The application is built on a modern technology stack, featuring **Next.js (v15.3.3)** with the App Router for a high-performance, server-rendered frontend. The backend is powered by Next.js API Routes, with a **MongoDB** database managed through the **Prisma ORM (v5.17.0)** for type-safe data access. The user interface is crafted with **React (v18.3.1)** and styled using **Tailwind CSS** and **ShadCN UI** components for a responsive and aesthetically pleasing design. Authentication is handled securely using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

The project successfully demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of a digital mess management system, addressing key problems such as long queues, food wastage, billing inaccuracies, and administrative overhead. The result is a scalable, maintainable, and robust application poised to enhance the dining experience in a modern hostel environment.

## CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION

### 1.1. Company Profile

For the context of this academic project, we assume the development was undertaken by a fictional software consultancy named **"CampusConnect Solutions"**.

**CampusConnect Solutions** is a technology startup dedicated to enhancing the educational experience through innovative software solutions. Founded on the principle that technology can solve the most pressing logistical challenges within academic institutions, the company specializes in creating bespoke platforms for universities, colleges, and schools.

Our mission is to digitize and automate administrative processes, freeing up valuable time for both staff and students, and fostering a more connected, efficient, and modern campus environment. From student information systems to digital library management and, as demonstrated by this project, smart mess management, CampusConnect Solutions is committed to building the future of educational technology.

### 1.1.1. Introduction to Project

MyMess is a comprehensive, full-stack web application designed to modernize and streamline hostel mess operations. It digitizes the entire workflow, from meal selection and token generation for students to user verification, menu management, and analytics for administrators. The system is built on a robust role-based access control (RBAC) model, providing tailored experiences and permissions for four distinct roles:

- **Students:** The primary users who interact with the system for their daily meals.
- **Mess Admins:** Staff responsible for day-to-day mess operations, primarily token verification.
- **Admins:** Hostel-specific administrators who manage students, staff, and hostel-level settings.
- **Super Admin:** The system-wide administrator with complete oversight and control over all hostels and users.

This application is built to be responsive, secure, and user-friendly, offering a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

### 1.2. The Existing System: An Analysis of Manual Inefficiency

In most traditional hostel environments, the management of the mess or dining hall relies on outdated and inefficient manual processes. These systems, while functional in their most basic sense, are fraught with logistical challenges, operational bottlenecks, and a fundamental lack of data integrity that make them ill-suited for the digital age. They represent a significant source of daily friction for students and a substantial administrative burden for the institution. A deep-dive into the components of a typical existing system reveals a cascade of interconnected problems that MyMess is designed to solve.

---

#### **1.2.1. The Foundation of Failure: Manual Registration and Data Silos**

The entire lifecycle of a student within the mess system begins with the registration process, which in a manual system, is the first point of failure.

**The Process:**
When a new student joins the hostel, they are typically required to visit the administrative office to register for mess services. This involves filling out a physical, multi-part paper form, providing details such as their full name, enrollment number, course, and hostel name. An administrator then takes this form and manually transcribes the information into a master ledger—a large, bound book that serves as the single source of truth for mess registrations. In slightly more advanced, yet equally problematic, setups, this data might be entered into a basic spreadsheet (e.g., Microsoft Excel) on a local computer.

**Inherent Flaws and Inefficiencies:**

1.  **Data Entry Errors:** The manual transcription of data from handwritten forms is a classic and significant source of errors. Illegible handwriting can lead to misspelled names, incorrect enrollment numbers, or the wrong hostel being recorded. These seemingly minor errors have significant downstream consequences, particularly during the critical billing phase.

2.  **Lack of Data Validation and Integrity:** A paper-and-pen system has no built-in validation mechanisms. There is no way to automatically check if an enrollment number is in the correct format, if a name has already been registered, or if the selected hostel is at capacity. This lack of data integrity means the foundational data upon which the entire system operates is unreliable from the very beginning.

3.  **Creation of Data Silos:** The physical ledger or the isolated spreadsheet file creates a "data silo." The information is locked in a single physical location or on a single machine. If another department, such as the finance or accounts office, requires access to this data for auditing or reporting purposes, it necessitates a cumbersome manual process—either physically transporting the ledger or emailing a static, potentially outdated copy of the spreadsheet. There is no centralized, real-time access to the data.

4.  **Physical Security and Durability Risks:** A physical ledger is susceptible to being lost, stolen, or damaged (e.g., by a water spill or fire). The loss of this single document would be catastrophic, effectively wiping out the entire record of mess registrations and consumption history, leading to an administrative and financial crisis.

---

#### **1.2.2. The Point-of-Service Bottleneck: Coupon and Signature-Based Meal Tracking**

The most visible and frustrating aspect of the manual system occurs at the point of service—the mess counter. This is where the foundational flaws of manual data management manifest as a tangible, daily inconvenience for students. The two most common methods for tracking meal consumption are the coupon system and the signature system.

**The Coupon System:**

- **The Process:** At the beginning of each month, students are issued a physical book of coupons, with separate, tear-away slips for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for each day. To get a meal, a student tears out the appropriate coupon and hands it to the mess staff.
- **Flaws:**
  - **Administrative Overhead:** The process of designing, printing, and distributing hundreds of these coupon books each month is a significant and recurring administrative cost.
  - **Loss, Theft, and Misuse:** Students frequently lose their coupon books, which creates another administrative task of verifying the loss and issuing a replacement. More critically, a lost or stolen book can be misused by another individual, leading to unauthorized meal consumption billed to the original student.
  - **Inflexibility:** The coupon system is rigid. It cannot easily accommodate the purchase of extra items (add-ons) or the selection of multiple meals (e.g., for a guest), requiring a separate, parallel manual tracking system for such exceptions.
  - **Tedious Reconciliation:** At the end of each day or month, mess staff are left with thousands of tiny, collected paper slips that must be manually sorted and counted, a highly inefficient and error-prone task.

**The Signature System:**

- **The Process:** A large register is kept at the mess counter, with a page for each day listing the names of all registered students. To get their meal, each student must locate their name in the list and place their signature next to the corresponding meal type (Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner).
- **Flaws:**
  - **The Queueing Problem:** This method is the primary driver of long queues. During peak hours, dozens of students are simultaneously trying to find their name in a list of hundreds, creating a significant bottleneck.
  - **Illegibility and Forgery:** Signatures are often rushed and illegible, making it difficult to verify them. Furthermore, the system is vulnerable to forgery, where one student can sign on behalf of another without any reliable way to detect the fraud.
  - **Physical Wear and Tear:** The register, handled by hundreds of people daily, quickly becomes worn, torn, and smudged, further complicating the process of reading names and verifying signatures.

**Shared Failures of Both Tracking Methods:**
The most critical failure shared by both systems is that the consumption data is only available _after_ the meal service is over. This historical data is useless for real-time kitchen planning. The kitchen staff have no way of knowing exactly how many students will be arriving for a given meal, forcing them to rely on crude estimates and leading directly to the over-preparation and wastage of food.

---

#### **1.2.3. The Communication Breakdown: Static Menus and Unreliable Announcements**

In an era of instant digital communication, the manual mess system remains reliant on the most archaic of information dissemination tools: the physical notice board.

- **Static Menu Display:** The weekly menu is typically printed and pinned to a notice board at the beginning of the week. This static display is incapable of reflecting real-time changes. If a particular vegetable is unavailable from the supplier, or if the chef decides to prepare a special item, there is no efficient way to update the student body. This creates a disconnect between student expectations and the actual meal served, leading to disappointment and complaints.

- **Ineffective Announcement Channel:** The notice board is an inherently unreliable method for conveying critical information. There is no guarantee that every student will see a notice posted. Important updates regarding mess closures for holidays or maintenance, changes in meal timings, or announcements about special dinners are easily missed. A student who misses such a notice may make a wasted trip to the mess, leading to understandable frustration and a negative perception of the hostel management.

---

#### **1.2.4. The Administrative Nightmare: The Manual Billing and Reconciliation Process**

The end-of-month billing process is the culmination of all the system's preceding failures. It is a logistical nightmare that represents a massive drain on administrative resources.

**The Process:**
An administrator must sit down with the master registration ledger and the entire month's collection of consumed coupons or the daily signature registers. With a calculator and a spreadsheet, they must manually go through each student's record, one by one, and count the number of meals they have consumed.

**The Inevitable Consequences:**

1.  **Extremely Labor-Intensive and Time-Consuming:** For a hostel with several hundred students, this is not a task of hours, but of days. It is a monotonous, high-volume, low-value task that consumes a significant portion of an administrator's work week at the end of every month.

2.  **A High Probability of Compounding Errors:** Every manual count and data entry point is a potential source of error. An error in tallying one student's meals can throw off the entire reconciliation process. If discrepancies are found, it can trigger a full, painstaking re-audit of the entire month's records.

3.  **The Inevitability of Disputes:** Because the underlying data from coupons or signatures is inherently untrustworthy and the process is opaque to students, billing disputes are not a possibility; they are a certainty. When a student contests a bill, the administrator must manually go back through the physical records to re-verify the consumption, a time-consuming process that often fails to provide a conclusive resolution, further damaging student trust.

---

#### **1.2.5. Concluding Analysis of the Existing System**

In summary, the traditional, manual hostel mess management system is a deeply flawed model that is fundamentally unsuited to the demands of a modern educational institution. It is a system defined by its **inefficiency**, which wastes the valuable time of students and staff; its **inaccuracy**, which leads to financial losses and billing disputes; its **lack of transparency**, which erodes trust; its **inability to scale**, which makes it increasingly unmanageable as the student population grows; and its **poor user experience**, which negatively impacts the daily lives of everyone it is meant to serve. These interconnected failures demonstrate a clear and urgent need for a digital transformation—a need that the MyMess project is designed to fulfill.

### 1.3. Problem Definition

The existing manual system for hostel mess management presents a significant number of problems that affect students, mess staff, and administrators. The core issues can be defined as follows:

1.  **Inefficiency and Time Consumption:** The manual process of signing registers or verifying coupons creates long queues, wasting students' valuable time. For administrators, the monthly task of calculating bills from these manual records is a laborious and inefficient use of resources.

2.  **Lack of Accuracy:** Manual data entry and counting are highly susceptible to human error. This can lead to incorrect meal counts, which in turn results in inaccurate billing for students and flawed data for the kitchen.

3.  **Food Wastage:** Without an accurate, real-time count of how many students will be eating a particular meal, the kitchen staff must rely on estimates. This often leads to over-preparation of food, resulting in significant wastage.

4.  **Absence of Transparency:** Students have no easy way to track their own meal consumption throughout the month. This lack of transparency can lead to disputes when the final bill is presented.

5.  **Poor Communication:** Relying on notice boards for important announcements is an outdated and unreliable method of communication in a connected campus environment.

6.  **Administrative Overhead:** The entire process requires significant manual labor for record-keeping, verification, and billing, increasing the operational costs of running the mess.

The MyMess project aims to solve these problems by providing a centralized, digital platform that automates these processes, enhances efficiency, and provides a transparent and convenient experience for all stakeholders.

### 1.4. Proposed System

The MyMess application is proposed as a comprehensive digital solution to overcome the limitations of the existing manual system. It introduces a role-based, web-accessible platform that automates and streamlines every aspect of hostel mess management.

The core of the proposed system is a digital workflow centered around a unique, single-use token for each meal selection. The system's functionalities are tailored to its four user roles:

**For Students:**

- **Digital Meal Selection:** Students can view the dynamic weekly menu and select their Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner directly from the dashboard. They can also specify the quantity needed.
- **Instant Token Generation:** Upon selection, the system generates a unique alphanumeric token.
- **Meal & Add-on History:** A personal dashboard allows students to view a complete log of all past meal selections and any extra items purchased.
- **Automated Monthly Summary:** Students can track their consumption in real-time and view an automatically calculated, estimated monthly bill, ensuring transparency.
- **Notifications:** Receive important announcements from administrators directly within the app.

**For Mess Admins:**

- **Token Verification:** A simple interface to enter a student's token. The system instantly verifies the token's validity, meal type, and quantity, and marks it as consumed.
- **Live Order View:** The dashboard shows a list of all active tokens for the current meal, including any selected add-ons, allowing the mess staff to prepare accordingly.
- **Menu Management:** Authority to update the weekly meal plan and manage the availability of add-on items.

**For Admins (Hostel-Specific):**

- **Student Verification & Management:** A secure portal to approve or reject new student registrations and manage the records of all students within their assigned hostel.
- **Staff Management:** The ability to create and manage accounts for Mess Admins.
- **Billing & Analytics:** Tools to upload monthly bills and view consumption analytics specific to their hostel.

**For the Super Admin:**

- **Global Oversight:** A system-wide dashboard with analytics for all hostels.
- **Full User Management:** The ability to create, view, and manage Admin and Mess Admin accounts across the entire system.

By implementing this system, MyMess directly addresses the problems of inefficiency, inaccuracy, and lack of transparency, providing a modern solution for a modern campus.

### 1.5. Project Scope and Objectives

**Project Scope:**
The scope of the MyMess project is to develop a fully functional web application for the complete management of a hostel mess dining system. The system's boundaries are defined as follows:

## CHAPTER 2: Design of Project

### 2.1. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) Model

The **Agile Methodology**, specifically using a **Scrum-like framework**, was chosen for the development of the MyMess project. This model was selected over traditional models like Waterfall because it offers the flexibility and adaptability required for a project of this nature, where user feedback and iterative improvement are key.

**Justification for using Agile:**

1.  **Iterative Development:** The project was developed in incremental stages or "sprints." For instance, core authentication was built first, followed by the student dashboard, then the admin functionalities. This allowed for a functional piece of the application to be ready and testable at the end of each cycle.
2.  **Flexibility and Adaptability:** The Agile approach allowed for changes to be incorporated easily. For example, the initial plan might not have included selecting meal quantities or detailed add-on management. These features were added in subsequent iterations based on a re-evaluation of user needs (emulated by the developer's interaction with the AI assistant).
3.  **Early and Continuous Feedback:** Each new feature or enhancement could be reviewed and tested immediately, allowing for rapid identification of bugs (like the `ObjectId` errors) and areas for UI/UX improvement.
4.  **Risk Management:** By building the most critical features first (user authentication, meal selection), the biggest risks were tackled early in the development process. This ensures that a core, valuable product exists even if later features are delayed.

**Phases in the Agile SDLC for MyMess:**

- **Concept & Inception:** Defining the overall vision for MyMess—a digital mess management system—and identifying the core problem and proposed solution.
- **Iteration Planning (Sprint Planning):** At the start of each development cycle, specific goals were set.
  - _Sprint 1:_ Setup project structure, database schema, and core user authentication (Login/Signup).
  - _Sprint 2:_ Develop the student dashboard for meal selection and token generation.
  - _Sprint 3:_ Build the mess admin dashboard for token verification.
  - _Sprint 4:_ Implement admin/superadmin dashboards and user management features.
  - _Sprint 5:_ Add supplementary features like notifications, feedback, and analytics.
- **Development & Testing:** Writing the code for the planned features and conducting continuous testing to ensure functionality and fix bugs.
- **Review & Retrospective:** At the end of a cycle, the newly developed features were reviewed. For example, after building the student dashboard, it was evaluated for usability, leading to subsequent UI enhancements.
- **Deployment:** After several successful iterations, the application is deployed for use.

  - `MyMess System` -> `Mess Admin`: Active Token List, Verification Status
  - `Admin` / `Super Admin` -> `MyMess System`: Login Credentials, New User Data, Menu Updates, Verification Decisions
  - `MyMess System` -> `Admin` / `Super Admin`: User Lists, Pending Requests, Analytics Data

#### Level-1 DFD

This diagram breaks down the "MyMess System" into its major sub-processes.

- **Processes:**
  1.  `Manage Authentication`
  2.  `Manage Meal Selections`
  3.  `Manage Menus`
  4.  `Manage Users`
  5.  `Manage Notifications & Feedback`
  6.  `Provide Analytics`
- **Data Stores:**
  - `D1: Users` (Stores all user data)
  - `D2: MenuItems` (Stores weekly menu)
  - `D3: MealSelections` (Stores meal tokens and history)
  - `D4: Notifications` (Stores announcements)
  - `D5: Feedback` (Stores user feedback)
- **Description of Flows:**
  - A **Student** provides `Login Credentials` to `1.0 Manage Authentication`, which validates against the `D1 Users` store. The student then sends a `Meal Choice` to `2.0 Manage Meal Selections`. This process generates a `Token`, stores the `Selection Record` in `D3 MealSelections`, and sends the `Token` back to the student.
  - A **Mess Admin** sends a `Submitted Token` to `2.0 Manage Meal Selections`. The process checks `D3 MealSelections`, updates the record's status to consumed, and returns a `Verification Result`.
  - An **Admin** sends `New Staff Details` to `4.0 Manage Users`, which creates a new record in the `D1 Users` store. The Admin also sends `Verification Decisions` to this process to update the status of pending students.
  - The `6.0 Provide Analytics` process reads from `D1 Users` and `D3 MealSelections` to generate `Consumption Reports` for the Admins.

    - Attributes: `id` (Primary Key), `displayId`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`, `status`, `hostel`, `enrollmentNumber`, `course`, `avatar`.
2.  **MenuItem:** Defines an item on the weekly menu.
    - Attributes: `id` (Primary Key), `dayOfWeek`, `mealType`, `item`, `notes`, `available`.
3.  **MealSelection:** Records each time a student generates a token for a meal.
    - Attributes: `id` (Primary Key), `date`, `token`, `consumed`, `quantity`, `createdAt`.
    - Foreign Keys: `userId` (references User).
4.  **Addon:** Defines extra items available for purchase.
    - Attributes: `id` (Primary Key), `name`, `price`, `available`.
5.  **AddonConsumption:** Links a `MealSelection` to any `Addon`s purchased with it.
    - Attributes: `id` (Primary Key), `quantity`, `priceAtConsumption`, `consumed`.
    - Foreign Keys: `userId`, `addonId`, `mealSelectionId`.
6.  **Bill:** Stores metadata about uploaded monthly bill files.
    - Attributes: `id` (Primary Key), `fileName`, `uploadDate`, `month`.

_Table 3.2: Development Tools_

### 3.3. Modules Description

The MyMess application is architected into several logical modules, primarily organized by feature domains. This modular structure enhances maintainability and separation of concerns.

**1. Authentication Module (`/app/api/auth/*`)**

- **Purpose:** Handles all user authentication and session management.
- **Components:** `login`, `signup`, `logout`, `request-password-reset`, and `reset-password` API routes.
- **Functionality:** Manages user credentials, password hashing (bcrypt), and the creation/verification of JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

**2. User & Verification Module (`/api/users`, `/api/admins`, `/api/verification`, etc.)**

- **Purpose:** Manages the creation, retrieval, and status updates of all user types.
- **Components:** API routes for fetching user lists, creating admin/mess admin accounts, and approving/rejecting student registrations.
- **Functionality:** Enforces role-based permissions to ensure that only authorized administrators can perform management tasks.

**3. Menu & Meal Management Module (`/api/menu`, `/api/meal-selections`, `/api/addons`)**

- **Purpose:** The core operational module for managing meals.
- **Components:** API routes for fetching the menu, creating meal selections (tokens), verifying tokens, and managing add-on items.
- **Functionality:** Handles the complete lifecycle of a meal, from menu display to consumption.

**4. Communication Module (`/api/notifications`, `/api/feedback`)**

- **Purpose:** Facilitates communication between administrators and students.
- **Components:** API routes for creating/deleting notifications and submitting/viewing feedback.
- **Functionality:** Acts as a simple messaging system within the application.

**5. Frontend UI Module (`/components`, `/app/(main)`, `/app/(auth)`)**

- **Purpose:** Contains all the client-facing components and pages.
- **Components:** Reusable UI components (from ShadCN UI), layout components (`MainSidebar`, `MainHeader`), and page components for each route.
- **Functionality:** Uses React and Next.js to render the user interface, manage client-side state with React Context (`AuthProvider`, `DataProvider`), and interact with the backend APIs.

### 3.4. Database Design

The database design is the backbone of the application, modeled using the Prisma schema definition language. The `prisma/schema.prisma` file serves as the single source of truth for the database structure.

**`schema.prisma`**

```prisma

```

### 3.4. I/O Screens, Explanation Actual

This section provides a detailed breakdown of the key input/output screens of the MyMess application. Each screen is analyzed based on its purpose, the user inputs it accepts, and the corresponding outputs or system responses.

---

#### **Screen 1: Login Screen**

![Login Screen](https://placehold.co/800x600.png)
_Figure 3.1: Login Screen_

**Purpose:**
The Login Screen serves as the secure gateway to the MyMess application. Its primary function is to authenticate registered users and establish a secure session, directing them to their respective dashboards based on their role.

**Inputs:**

1.  **Email Address (Text Input):** The user enters their registered email address. Client-side validation ensures that the input is in a valid email format before submission.
2.  **Password (Password Input):** The user enters their password. The input field is of type `password`, which masks the characters for security.
3.  **"Log In" Button (Click Event):** The user clicks this button to submit their credentials to the server for verification.
4.  **"Forgot Password?" Link (Navigation Event):** A hyperlink that redirects the user to the password reset page.
5.  **"Sign up" Link (Navigation Event):** A hyperlink that redirects the user to the student registration page.

**Processing:**
Upon clicking the "Log In" button, the front-end sends a `POST` request to the `/api/auth/login` endpoint with the email and password in the request body. The backend server then performs the following steps:

- It finds a user in the database with the matching email address.
- If a user is found, it uses `bcrypt.js` to compare the submitted password with the stored hashed password.
- If the credentials are valid, it generates a JSON Web Token (JWT) containing the user's ID and role.
- This JWT is set as an `HttpOnly` cookie in the response header.

**Outputs:**

- **Successful Authentication:** The API returns a `200 OK` status with the user's data. The front-end then uses the Next.js router to redirect the user to their appropriate dashboard (`/student` for students, `/admin` for all other roles).
- **Failed Authentication:** The API returns a `401 Unauthorized` status. The front-end receives this error and displays a toast notification with the message "Invalid credentials. Please try again." The user remains on the login page.
- **Loading State:** While the API request is in progress, the "Log In" button is disabled and displays a loading spinner to provide visual feedback to the user.

---

#### **Screen 2: Student Dashboard & Meal Selection**

![Student Dashboard Screen](https://placehold.co/800x600.png)
_Figure 3.2: Student Dashboard Screen_

**Purpose:**
This is the central hub for the student user. Its primary purpose is to display the day's menu and provide an intuitive interface for selecting a meal and generating a token.

**Inputs:**

1.  **"Get Token" Button (Click Event):** The user clicks the button corresponding to the meal they wish to select (e.g., Breakfast, Lunch, or Dinner).
2.  **Quantity Selection (Click Events):** Inside the meal configuration dialog, the user clicks the `+` or `-` buttons to adjust the quantity of meals required.
3.  **Add-on Selection (Click Event):** Inside the token display dialog, the user can click an "Add" button next to an available extra item.
4.  **"Generate Token" / "Done" Buttons (Click Events):** The user clicks these buttons to confirm their choices and close the dialogs.

**Processing:**

- **Meal Selection:** Clicking "Get Token" opens a dialog for quantity selection. When the user confirms, a `POST` request is sent to the `/api/meal-selections` endpoint with the `userId`, `mealType`, `date`, and `quantity`. The backend validates that the user has not already selected this meal for the day, then creates a new `MealSelection` record in the database with a unique, randomly generated token.
- **Add-on Selection:** Clicking "Add" for an add-on sends a `POST` request to `/api/addon-consumptions` with the `addonId` and the `mealSelectionId` of the current active token. The backend creates a new record in the `AddonConsumption` linking table.

**Outputs:**

- **Successful Token Generation:** The API returns the newly created `MealSelection` object. The front-end then displays another dialog box showing the generated token in a large, easy-to-read format. This dialog also lists available add-ons.
- **Failed Token Generation:** If the user has already taken a token for that meal, the API returns a `409 Conflict` error. The front-end displays a toast notification with the error message "You have already selected [MealType] for today."
- **Successful Add-on Addition:** The UI updates to show the add-on as "Added," and a success toast appears.
- **Loading State:** During API requests (for both meal and add-on selection), the corresponding button shows a loading spinner to indicate that the system is processing the request.

---

#### **Screen 3: Token Verification Screen (Mess Admin)**

![Token Verification Screen](https://placehold.co/800x600.png)
_Figure 3.3: Token Verification Screen_

**Purpose:**
This screen is designed for maximum efficiency for mess staff. Its sole purpose is to allow for the rapid verification of student meal tokens at the point of service.

**Inputs:**

1.  **Token Input (Text Input):** The Mess Admin types the 5-character alphanumeric token provided by the student into the input field. The input field automatically converts the text to uppercase to prevent case-sensitivity issues.
2.  **"Verify" Button (Click Event):** The Mess Admin clicks this button to submit the token for verification.

**Processing:**
The front-end sends a `PATCH` request to the `/api/meal-selections/verify` endpoint with the token string. The backend logic then:

- Searches for a `MealSelection` record with a matching token for the current date.
- Checks if the token has already been marked as `consumed`.
- If the token is valid and not consumed, it updates the `consumed` flag to `true` for both the meal selection and any associated add-on consumptions within a single database transaction to ensure atomicity.
- It fetches the student's name and details of the consumed add-ons to return in the response.

**Outputs:**

- **Successful Verification:** The API returns a `200 OK` status with the verified meal and add-on data. The front-end displays a success toast and a "Verified Meal Card" showing the student's name, meal, quantity, and a list of their chosen add-ons. The input field is cleared for the next token. The "Active Tokens" table on the page is updated to remove the just-verified token.
- **Failed Verification:** If the token is invalid, expired, or already used, the API returns an appropriate error status (`404 Not Found` or `409 Conflict`). The front-end displays an error toast with a descriptive message (e.g., "This token has already been used.").
- **Loading State:** The "Verify" button is disabled and shows a loading spinner during the API call.

---

#### **Screen 4: User Verification Screen (Admin)**

![User Verification Screen](https://placehold.co/800x600.png)
_Figure 3.4: User Verification Screen_

**Purpose:**
This screen provides a secure interface for Hostel Admins to manage the queue of pending student registration requests for their specific hostel.

**Inputs:**

1.  **"Approve" Button (Click Event):** The admin clicks this button for a student they wish to approve.
2.  **"Reject" Button (Click Event):** The admin clicks this button for a student they wish to reject.
3.  **Confirmation Dialog (Click Event):** After clicking "Approve" or "Reject," a confirmation dialog appears. The admin must click the final confirmation button within this dialog to proceed.

**Processing:**
Upon confirmation, a `PATCH` request is sent to the `/api/verification/[id]` endpoint, where `[id]` is the ID of the student being actioned upon. The request body contains the new status (`'APPROVED'` or `'REJECTED'`). The backend validates the admin's authority to manage the student (based on hostel), updates the student's `status` field in the database, and if the student is approved, triggers the sending of a welcome email.

**Outputs:**

- **Successful Update:** The API returns a `200 OK` status. The front-end immediately removes the student's row from the pending list table in the UI, providing instant visual confirmation of the action. A success toast notification is displayed (e.g., "Student Approved").
- **Failed Update:** If an error occurs on the backend, a `500` or other error status is returned. The front-end displays an error toast.
- **Loading State:** While the API request is in progress for a specific student, the action buttons for that row can be replaced with a loading spinner to prevent duplicate clicks.

## CHAPTER 5: Results and Discussion

### 5.1. Results

The MyMess project was successfully developed and implemented, meeting all the primary objectives set forth in the project proposal. The final result is a fully functional, full-stack web application that provides a modern, digital solution for hostel mess management.

- **A Working System:** The application is live and operational, with all core features for the four user roles (Student, Mess Admin, Admin, Super Admin) implemented and tested.
- **Achievement of Objectives:**
  - The process is fully digitized, eliminating the need for paper registers.
  - Efficiency is significantly improved, with token generation and verification being near-instantaneous.
  - Data accuracy is ensured through a centralized database and automated calculations.
  - Transparency is achieved by providing students with access to their meal history and estimated bills.
  - Administrative workload is reduced through automated user management and menu update tools.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application boasts a clean, responsive, and intuitive user interface, making it easy to use for all stakeholders with minimal training.

### 5.2. Discussion

The development of MyMess provides valuable insights into the benefits and challenges of digitizing traditional systems.

**Advantages of the Implemented System:**
The MyMess application offers significant advantages over the manual system it replaces.

- **For Students:** The primary benefit is convenience. Students can manage their meals from anywhere, avoid long queues, and have full transparency over their consumption and billing.
- **For Mess Staff:** The verification process is simplified to a quick token entry, making their job faster and less stressful during peak hours. The live view of active tokens helps in managing service flow.
- **For Administration:** The automation of repetitive tasks like billing and user verification frees up significant administrative time. The availability of digital records and analytics allows for better decision-making, particularly in budget planning and reducing food wastage.

**Challenges Encountered and Solutions:**
Throughout the development process, several challenges were encountered:

- **Data Integrity and Schema Evolution:** Initial versions of the database schema led to data inconsistency issues, such as `Malformed ObjectID` errors. This was a critical bug that caused API crashes.
  - **Solution:** The problem was systematically resolved by:
    1.  Refining the Prisma schema to be more robust (e.g., making foreign keys non-nullable).
    2.  Implementing strict validation and error handling in the API endpoints to catch invalid data and prevent crashes.
    3.  Ensuring all new data conformed to the correct format (e.g., using `cuid()` for IDs where appropriate).
- **UI/UX Iteration:** The initial designs for some pages, particularly the student dashboard, were deemed not user-friendly enough.
  - **Solution:** An iterative design process was adopted. Based on feedback, the dashboard was redesigned multiple times, moving from a multi-card layout to a more intuitive, full-width menu-style layout, which significantly improved the user experience.
- **State Management Complexity:** Managing and synchronizing data across various components and user roles (e.g., ensuring a verified token immediately reflects in all relevant tables) posed a challenge.
  - **Solution:** A centralized state management approach using React's Context API (`AuthProvider` and `DataProvider`) was implemented. This provided a single source of truth for application data, ensuring consistency across the UI.

## The successful resolution of these challenges has resulted in a more stable, robust, and user-friendly application.

## CHAPTER 6: Conclusion and Future Scope

### 6.1. Conclusion

The MyMess project successfully culminates in the creation of a comprehensive and scalable web application that effectively addresses the inefficiencies of traditional hostel mess management. By leveraging a modern technology stack centered around Next.js and Prisma, the project transforms a manual, error-prone process into a streamlined, digital workflow.

The system provides tangible benefits for all its users: students gain convenience and transparency, mess staff gain efficiency, and administrators gain powerful tools for management and oversight. The role-based architecture ensures that each user has access to a tailored and secure experience.

Through its iterative development, the project has not only met its initial objectives but has also evolved to include more nuanced features like meal quantity selection and add-on management, demonstrating the power of the Agile approach. In conclusion, MyMess stands as a robust proof-of-concept and a solid foundation for a real-world campus utility, effectively showcasing how modern web technologies can be applied to solve practical, everyday problems.

### 6.2. Limitations of the Project

While the current version of MyMess is a fully functional application, it has certain limitations that provide opportunities for future work:

1.  **No Integrated Payment System:** Students can see their estimated bill, but there is no integrated payment gateway to pay the bill online. The billing process still requires an out-of-band payment and manual reconciliation by the admin.
2.  **No Real-time QR Code Scanning:** Token verification is based on manually typing an alphanumeric code. A system using QR codes would be faster and less prone to typing errors. This would require a mobile app or browser with camera access.
3.  **Basic Analytics:** The analytics dashboard provides a good overview of consumption trends but lacks more advanced reporting features, such as filtering by custom date ranges, per-student analysis, or identifying peak hours.
4.  **No Inventory Management:** The system does not track the mess's raw material inventory. This means that food preparation is still based on consumption data rather than a full stock management system.
5.  **Limited Offline Capability:** The application requires a constant internet connection to function. It does not have offline capabilities for meal selection or token generation.

### 6.3. Future Scope

The MyMess platform is designed to be extensible, and there are numerous avenues for future enhancement that could further increase its value.

1.  **Payment Gateway Integration:** Integrate with popular payment gateways like Stripe, Razorpay, or Paytm to allow students to pay their monthly mess bills directly through the application.
2.  **QR Code Implementation:**
    - Generate a unique QR code for each meal token.
    - Develop a companion mobile app or a web-based scanner for Mess Admins to scan the QR codes, making the verification process instantaneous.
3.  **Advanced Analytics and Reporting:**
    - Create a more detailed analytics dashboard with customizable reports.
    - Use AI/ML to forecast meal demand with greater accuracy based on historical data, helping to further reduce food wastage.
    - Implement AI-powered analysis of student feedback to identify common themes and suggestions.
4.  **Inventory Management Module:** Add a new module for mess administrators to manage kitchen inventory, track stock levels, and generate purchase orders for suppliers.
5.  **Mobile Application:** Develop dedicated native mobile applications for iOS and Android to provide a more seamless user experience, push notifications, and offline access capabilities.
6.  **Enhanced Notification System:** Allow admins to send targeted notifications to specific hostels or groups of students.
7.  **Dietary Preferences:** Allow students to specify dietary preferences or allergies in their profiles, which can be used by the mess for planning.
