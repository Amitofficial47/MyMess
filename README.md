# MyMess - Smart Hostel Mess Management System

## 1. Project Overview

MyMess is a comprehensive, full-stack web application designed to modernize and streamline hostel mess operations. It digitizes the entire workflow, from meal selection and token generation for students to user verification, menu management, and analytics for administrators.

The system is built on a robust role-based access control (RBAC) model, providing tailored experiences and permissions for four distinct roles:

- **Students:** The primary users who interact with the system for their daily meals.
- **Mess Admins:** Staff responsible for day-to-day mess operations, primarily token verification.
- **Admins:** Hostel-specific administrators who manage students, staff, and hostel-level settings.
- **Super Admin:** The system-wide administrator with complete oversight and control over all hostels and users.

This application is built to be responsive, secure, and user-friendly, offering a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 3. System Architecture & Tech Stack

MyMess is built using a modern, robust, and type-safe technology stack, prioritizing developer experience and performance.

### Architecture

- **Monorepo Structure:** The frontend and backend are colocated within a single Next.js project.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Leverages Next.js with the App Router for fast initial page loads and improved SEO. Server Components are used by default to minimize client-side JavaScript.
- **RESTful API:** The backend is exposed via API Routes within Next.js, handling all data mutations and business logic.
- **Component-Based UI:** The frontend is built with reusable React components, ensuring a consistent and maintainable user interface.
- **Centralized State Management:** Client-side state is managed via React's Context API, providing a clean way to handle authentication (`AuthProvider`) and application data (`DataProvider`).

## 4. Database Schema

The data is modeled in `prisma/schema.prisma` and consists of the following main entities:

- `User`: Stores user information, including their role, status, and credentials.
- `MenuItem`: Defines the weekly menu, with an entry for each meal type on each day.
- `MealSelection`: Records each time a student generates a token for a meal, including quantity.
- `Addon`: Defines the extra items available for purchase.
- `AddonConsumption`: Links a `MealSelection` to any `Addon`s purchased with it.
- `Bill`: Stores metadata about uploaded monthly bill files.
- `Feedback`: Stores feedback submitted by students.
- `Notification`: Stores announcements created by administrators.

    DATABASE_URL="your-mongodb-connection-string"

    # 2. JWT Secrets
    # Generate TWO DIFFERENT secure random strings (e.g., `openssl rand -hex 32` in your terminal).
    # JWT_SECRET is for user sessions.
    # JWT_RESET_SECRET is for the short-lived password reset tokens.
    JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key"
