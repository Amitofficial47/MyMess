## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the MessMate project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or later) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your system. You will also need a database for Prisma to connect to (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, or a free MongoDB Atlas instance).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Get the code:**
    Clone the repository or download the source code.

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This will also automatically run `prisma generate` to create the Prisma Client types.

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project and add the following variables.

    ```env
    # The connection string for your database.
    # Example for MongoDB: DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://user:pass@host/db_name?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
    DATABASE_URL="your-database-connection-string"

    # A secret key for signing JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
    # Generate a secure random string for this (e.g., using a password manager).
    JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key"

    # Credentials for the initial Super Admin account that will be created by the seed script.
    SUPERADMIN_EMAIL="superadmin@messmate.com"
    SUPERADMIN_PASSWORD="superadmin"

    # The public URL of your application, especially important when using ngrok.
    # Leave this blank for local development without ngrok.
    NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=
    ```

4.  **Push Database Schema:**
    Apply the schema to your database. This command will create the necessary tables/collections.

    ```bash
    npx prisma db push
    ```

5.  **Seed the Database:**
    Run the seed script to create the initial superadmin user and populate the default weekly menu.

    ```bash
    npx prisma db seed
    ```

6.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Your application will now be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Exposing Your Local Server (with ngrok)

This project is integrated with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to easily create a secure, shareable URL for your local development server.

1.  **Create a free ngrok account:**
    Sign up at the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup).

2.  **Get your authtoken:**
    Find your authtoken on your [dashboard's "Your Authtoken" page](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken).

3.  **Connect your account (one-time setup):**

    ```bash
    npx ngrok config add-authtoken <YOUR_AUTHTOKEN>
    ```

4.  **Expose your server:**
    First, ensure your development server is running (`npm run dev`). Then, in a **separate terminal window**, run:

    ```bash
    npm run expose
    ```

    ngrok will start and display a public URL (e.g., `https://random-string.ngrok-free.app`).

5.  **Update your `.env` file:**
    Copy the public ngrok URL. Open the `.env` file and update the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` variable.
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://<your-random-string>.ngrok-free.app
    ```
    **Important:** You may need to restart your main development server (`npm run dev`) for this change to take effect.

### Login Credentials

- **Super Admin:**
  - Email: `email.com` (or as configured in `.env`)
  - Password: `password` (or as configured in `.env`)
- **Admin:** Admins are created by the Super Admin via the "Manage Admins" dashboard.
- **Student:** Create a new student account through the signup page. The account will be `PENDING` until approved by a hostel admin.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Architecture and Implementation Details

### 1. Core Technology Stack

- **Next.js 14 (App Router):** The application is built on the App Router paradigm, utilizing Server Components, Layouts, and file-based routing. Route groups (`(auth)`, `(main)`) organize routes with different layouts.
- **Prisma:** Acts as the ORM to manage interactions with the database, defining the schema for users and menu items.

### 2. Authentication and Authorization

- **Role-Based System:** The `User` model includes a `role` (`STUDENT`, `ADMIN`, `SUPERADMIN`) and a `status` (`PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`).
- **JWT Authentication:** User sessions are managed using JSON Web Tokens, which are stored in secure, `HttpOnly` cookies. This prevents common XSS attacks.
- **Protected Routes:** The main application layout (`src/app/(main)/layout.tsx`) acts as a security checkpoint. It verifies the user's session via an API call. If the user is not authenticated, they are redirected to `/login`.
- **Student Verification Flow:**
  1.  A new user signs up and is created with a `PENDING` status.
  2.  The student can log in but will only see a status page indicating their registration is under review.
  3.  The relevant hostel Admin sees this pending request on their "Verify Students" page.
  4.  The Admin can `Approve` or `Reject` the request.
  5.  Once `APPROVED`, the student gains full access to the student portal on their next visit.

### 3. Data Management

The application uses a hybrid approach for data management:

- **Database (via Prisma):** All `User` data (including students, admins, and superadmins) is stored in a persistent database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB). This is the "single source of truth" for all user-related information.
- **`localStorage` (Simulated Backend):** To simplify development and focus on UI/UX, other data like meal selections, notifications, bills, and feedback are managed on the client-side and persisted in the browser's `localStorage`. This is handled by the `DataProvider` context. In a full production application, these would also be migrated to the database.

### 4. Responsive Design

- **`useIsMobile` Hook:** A custom hook detects if the user is on a mobile-sized screen, allowing components to adapt their layout.
- **Adaptive Components:** Many pages switch between a table view on desktops to a more readable card-based layout on mobile screens (e.g., Bill Status, Meal History). The main navigation sidebar also collapses on desktop and becomes a slide-out sheet on mobile.
